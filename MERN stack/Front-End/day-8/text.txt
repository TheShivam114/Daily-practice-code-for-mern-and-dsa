1. What is HTML and Why It is Required?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the base of every website
you see. It tells the browser how to structure and display the content.
Think of it like the skeleton of a human body – without it, there’s no
structure.

HyperText: Text that can link to other texts or resources.

Markup: Special tags used to define structure and meaning of content.

Language: A set of rules for writing web pages.

Real-Life Example:Creating a resume in MS Word where you add headings,
paragraphs, bullet points etc. Similarly, in websites, HTML tags tell
the browser: this is a heading, this is a paragraph, this is a list.
 

2. Importance & Role of HTML
    1.Structure: D efines how text, images, links, and media are placed.
    2.Accessibility: Helps screen readers and assistive technologies understand
      content.
    3.SEO: Search engines read HTML to rank websites.
    4.Presentation: Provides meaningful structure before CSS styles it.
    5.Universal: Works across all devices and browsers.

HTML Notes
3. HTML Boilerplate
Before adding content, we start with a boilerplate. It’s like laying
down the foundation of a house before putting furniture inside.



Explanation:
*<!DOCTYPE html> → Defines document type as HTML5.

*<html lang="en"> → Root element. lang="en" means English language.

*<head> → Metadata (title, encoding, styles, etc).

*<meta charset="UTF-8"> → Supports all characters (English, Hindi, emojis,
 etc).

*<meta name="viewport"> → Makes site responsive on mobile.

*<title> → Title shown on browser tab.

*<body> → Everything visible on the webpage.

 Real-Life Example:
head is like the admin details of a building, and body is where
people actually live.
