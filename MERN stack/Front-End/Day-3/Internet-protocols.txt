1. What is TCP Protocol and Why It Is Widely Used
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the core 
    communication standards of the internet.

     .It ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
     .Large data is broken into smaller packets, and TCP makes sure they are 
       reassembled in the correct order at the destination.
     .If any packet is lost or corrupted, TCP automatically resends it.
     .This is why TCP is known for accuracy, reliability, and proper 
       sequencing.
   *Example Use Cases:
     Web browsing, sending emails, downloading files (FTP).
2. How Connection is Established Using TCP
    (3-Way Handshake)
 Before sending data, TCP ensures that both client and server are 
 ready by performing a 3-way handshake:
 1.SYN (synchronize) → Client sends a request to the server: “Can we 
   connect?”
 2.SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) → Server replies: “Yes, I’m ready.”
 3.ACK (acknowledge) → Client confirms: “Okay, let’s start.”
  **After these 3 steps, the connection is established.
 This ensures synchronization and reliability between client and server.

3. What is UDP and Why It Is Used for Fast                          
   Communication
 *UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is another major protocol, but unlike 
  TCP, it focuses on speed over reliability.
    .It sends packets directly without checking if they are received.
    .There is no error correction and no sequencing.
    .Packets may get lost or arrive in the wrong order, but communication 
     remains very fast.
 *Example Use Cases:
   Video streaming, online gaming, voice and video calls — where speed 
   matters more than 100% accuracy.
4. How UDP Works
  *UDP skips connection setup and directly sends packets:
    .No handshake is required.
    .Client → directly sends packets → Server.
    .Some packets may be lost, but because of its low latency, it’s ideal for 
    real-time communication.
